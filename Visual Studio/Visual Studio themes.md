# The procedure

First, install the free VS extension "Color Theme Editor":

*   For [VS 2013](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MatthewJohnsonMSFT.VisualStudio2013ColorThemeEditor).
*   For [VS 2015](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.VisualStudio2015ColorThemeEditor).
*   For [VS 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2017ColorThemeEditor).

Second, download my color theme on GitHub:

*   For [VS 2013](https://github.com/ChrisBertrandDotNet/Programming-in-blue/raw/master/Visual%20Studio/VS2013-Life-in-blue.vstheme).
*   For [VS 2015](https://github.com/ChrisBertrandDotNet/Programming-in-blue/raw/master/Visual%20Studio/VS2015-Life-in-blue.vstheme).
*   For [VS 2017](https://github.com/ChrisBertrandDotNet/Programming-in-blue/raw/master/Visual%20Studio/VS2017-Life-in-blue.vstheme).

Third, apply the theme:

1.  Run VS.
2.  Open menus Tools → Customize Colors.
3.  Click on "Import theme" (that is on the right of the panel).
4.  Click on the theme that has been added to Custom Themes, in order to activate it.

# Please help by completing the theme

I set up the color themes at least for my personal usage (mainly C#, XML and XAML). I did not check formats I do not use, such as C++, VB or F#.  
Consequently, you may encounter wrong colors in some text formats.

The main reason is the color set of a theme is enormous indeed: about 2700 colors in VS 2017.  
I suggested improvements that would reduce the work of a theme creator to about 30 colors. Feel free to discuss or support this proposal:
