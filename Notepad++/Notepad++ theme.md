# The procedure

In Notepad++, that is quite easy.

2.  Download [the theme file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisBertrandDotNet/Programming-in-blue/master/Notepad%2B%2B/Life-in-blue.xml) from the GitHub repository.
    
3.  Copy this file to the Notepad++ local theme directory:  
	`C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\themes`
	(Enter `%appdata%\Notepad++\themes` as a path in the File Explorer)
    
4.  Start Notepad++.
    
5.  Open menus Settings → Style Configurator..
    
6.  Select theme:  
    Life-in-blue

3.  Font style: select a font.
    
4.  Button Save & Close
    

# Please help by completing the theme

I set up this color theme at least for my personal usage (mainly C#, XML, HTML and XAML). I did not check formats I do not use, such as C++, VB or F#.  
Consequently, you may encounter wrong colors in some text formats.

The main reason is the color set of a theme is huge: about 1280 colors.
