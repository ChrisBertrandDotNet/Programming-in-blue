# The procedure

In Notepad++, that is quite easy.

1.  Close all Notepad++ windows.
    
2.  Download [the theme file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisBertrandDotNet/Programming-in-blue/master/Notepad++-Programming-in-blue.xml) from the GitHub repository.
    
3.  Copy this file to the Notepad++ local theme directory:  
    `%appdata%\Notepad++\themes`
    
4.  Start Notepad++.
    
5.  Open menus Settings → Style Configurator..
    
6.  Select theme:  
    Notepad++-Programming-in-blue

By default, this theme uses the Verdana font.  
If you want to select another font, please do that:

2.  Select Style: Default style.
    
3.  Font style: select a font.

# Please help by completing the theme

I set up the color themes at least for my personal usage (mainly C#, XML, HTML and XAML). I did not check formats I do not use, such as C++, VB or F#.  
Consequently, you may encounter wrong colors in some text formats.

The main reason is the color set of a theme is huge: about 1280 colors.
